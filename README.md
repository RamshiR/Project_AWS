## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing **daily CO₂ emissions from taxi rides** in NYC, with the goal of identifying patterns and opportunities to reduce emissions. Using **PySpark** for data processing and **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualizations, the analysis compares rides with **1-2 passengers vs. 3+ passengers**, providing actionable insights for sustainable transportation.  

This project demonstrates my skills in:
- **Big Data processing** with PySpark
- **Data analysis and visualization**
- **Sustainability-focused analytics**
- **Python programming** in a real-world use case

## **How to Run the Project**

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RamshiR/Project_Azure.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure **Python 3.x** and **PySpark** are installed. You can install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install pyspark matplotlib seaborn pandas
   ```

3. **Prepare Data**  
   - Place the dataset (e.g., `taxi_data.csv`) in the `data/` folder, or connect to your cloud storage for larger datasets.

4. **Run the Analysis Script**  
   ```bash
   python src/emissions_analysis.py
   ```

5. **Using Jupyter Notebooks (Optional)**  
   Open the notebook to explore the analysis interactively:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/emissions_analysis.ipynb
   ```

- **Finding:** Rides with **1-2 passengers** generate more emissions overall, suggesting a need to promote **ride-sharing**.  
- **Trend:** Emissions vary significantly by day, indicating that targeted interventions during peak travel times may reduce emissions.  

---

## **Insights & Recommendations**

1. **Encourage Ride-sharing Programs**  
   - Promote **multi-passenger rides** through financial incentives or discounts to reduce emissions per passenger.  

2. **Electrify the Taxi Fleet**  
   - Transition from gasoline-powered taxis to **electric vehicles (EVs)** or hybrids to significantly cut emissions.  

3. **Implement AI-Based Route Optimization**  
   - Use AI algorithms to **reduce idle times** and **avoid congestion**, minimizing fuel consumption.  

4. **Offer Off-Peak Travel Discounts**  
   - Encourage travel during off-peak hours to distribute traffic more evenly and reduce emissions.
